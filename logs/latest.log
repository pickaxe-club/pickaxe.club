[02:08:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> didn't we decide that?
[02:08:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> it's documented on minecraft.gamepedia
[02:08:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I just chop the trunk, and I think it drops doubles sometimes from the leaves automatically
[02:08:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> that's cool
[02:08:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> wasn't sure about that part
[02:08:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> seems too much work to chop leaves
[02:09:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> since the axe doesn't really apply to the leaves.

[02:38:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> CobyR, it has a rail
[02:38:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> so northwest of city hall
[02:38:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> starts northwest of city hall, past the new village, now dubbed the sweatshop
[02:38:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> bring a minecart and hop on
