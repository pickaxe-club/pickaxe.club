[03:03:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> How many do we want to fight?
[03:04:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> don't care
[03:04:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Same. I've got a few hours before bed. How many do we have the materials for?
[03:04:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Right now, 2.
[03:04:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Suppose we should fight 2, then. :)
[03:05:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[03:05:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> But that can be... enhanced.
[03:05:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> By the way, is there any faster way to get the wither heads than running around a nether fortress?

[03:06:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Ah, I see. :)
[03:06:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Other than that, no. But I gave up on that after the first few withers. Took too long.
[03:06:38] [Server thread/WARN]: tyrosinase moved wrongly!
[03:06:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> I'm up for fighting more. If we have enough to have some spare, I'd love to have a beacon
[03:06:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> out at my compound.

[03:07:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> take a star
[03:07:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I gave a beacon to Ryan. He put it near the brewery for speed.
[03:07:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> makes it nice not to slow down in that area
[03:07:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Nice. Speed just makes life so much easier.
[03:08:02] [Server thread/INFO]: [McPhage: Given [Wither Skeleton Skull] * 12 to McPhage]

[03:08:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> maybe record again?
[03:09:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> I could if you want me to, I guess. Can't turn up the sound, Nate's in bed.

[03:13:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Ready when you are
[03:14:31] [Server thread/INFO]: xcave has just earned the achievement [The Beginning.]
[03:14:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> We get the star?
[03:14:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> yep. just gave it to fish
[03:14:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Ah yeah, got it now.
[03:14:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Thanks!

[03:15:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> r2g?
[03:15:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Yep
[03:16:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> got it
[03:16:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> cool
[03:16:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Swell
[03:17:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Man, blast protections is pretty handy
[03:17:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> r2g.
[03:17:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> g2g?
[03:17:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> go
[03:20:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[03:21:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Well, that was messy
[03:21:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> well that escalated quickly
[03:21:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Did we get the star?
[03:21:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> i have it
[03:21:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> coo
[03:21:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> I'm all "Just hangin' out in the treetops, throwin' fireballs into the distance."
[03:21:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> lol
[03:22:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> What was it even firing at?
[03:22:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> me a few times
[03:22:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Do withers go for passive mobs?
[03:22:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> The distance. And a pig once, and a chicken just never had a chance.
[03:22:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Yes.
[03:22:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Apparently, anyway.
[03:22:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Maybe they were just in the line of fire.
[03:22:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> One time qrush and I were fighting one, and after it killed qrush, it went after some squid
[03:23:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> lol
[03:23:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Wait until dawn, or try at night?
[03:23:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Wait until dawn. It'll attack the mobs, but they'll get in our way
[03:23:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Fair enough.
[03:23:40] [Server thread/INFO]: [tyrosinase: Set the time to 0]
[03:23:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Or, that.
[03:23:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Well, we're the only ones on.
[03:23:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> nice
[03:23:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> I was going to brew some potions, but.
[03:24:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> LET'S DO THIS!
[03:25:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[03:25:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Just gotta keep fighting until we wear it down to bedrock. :)
[03:25:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> g2g?
[03:25:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Yep
[03:25:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> yes
[03:26:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> got it again
[03:26:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> excellent
[03:27:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> that blasted me pretty good w/ the first shot
[03:27:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Heh, yeah- you shot up like popcorn in a kettle.
[03:27:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> running out of juice bottles so GO GO GO

[03:28:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> g2g?
[03:28:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> yep
[03:28:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> go
[03:29:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> 4
[03:29:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> once it goes yellow, the arrows don't hurt it
[03:29:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> has to be swords
[03:30:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Oh, right
[03:30:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[03:30:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> They still push it tho'
[03:30:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Or fists.
[03:30:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> or that
[03:30:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Okay, so, that was 6.
[03:30:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> You know, just to make it sporting.
[03:30:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> 5
[03:30:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> 6?
[03:30:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Yeah.
[03:30:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> yeah, 6
[03:30:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> That was... silly easy
[03:30:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> who needs beacons?
[03:30:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> well, we are juicin
[03:30:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> I was hoping to put a set in town further out
[03:30:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> I'm sure beacons are always in demand. :)
[03:31:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> can I keep a star?
[03:31:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Do we want to do more? I'd like to grab some more potions
[03:31:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I'm out of potions
[03:31:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> I'm up for it.
[03:31:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> but have enough left for 1 more
[03:31:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Yeah, should do a potion run.
[03:31:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Then let's regroup in, say, 10 minutes?
[03:31:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> ok
[03:31:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Sounds good.
[03:31:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> I'll grab a few strengths to leave here.
[03:32:19] [Server thread/INFO]: [McPhage: Set own game mode to Spectator Mode]
