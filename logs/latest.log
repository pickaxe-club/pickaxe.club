[02:05:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <UncleAdam> yay!
[02:05:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Yeah, I spent all day working on the sugar farm right next to it. :)

[02:28:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> I've got a handfull in a pen at my base- suppose I could drag a few through the nether back to
[02:28:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> pickaxe city
[02:28:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> I'm gonna ride Son of Midnight (speed 11!) to The Farm and see if there are still any there.

[02:38:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> I HATE IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS
[02:39:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Never trust a pig with your keys. They always go for joyrides.w
[02:39:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> It was someone else's unattended minecart.
[02:40:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[02:40:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Well this is a first- I think I'm actually running low on redstone. That hasn't happened in months.
[02:40:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Gonna have to get back to mining.
[02:42:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Wow, and none at City Hall. There's some in north pickaxe city, but I don't remember how much.
[02:42:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Haven't done much mining, mostly aboveground dirt moving.
[02:42:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> I've been doing mostly farming and building recently.
[02:42:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> This sugarcane farm is great, but a little heavy on the redstone.
[02:43:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Okay, there are three pigs back in with the horses.
[02:43:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> For the sake of completeness, I dunno why. Not like I've felt compelled to have a bunny cage.
[02:44:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Do we have ocelot breeding pen yet?
[02:44:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Not that I'm aware of.
[02:45:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[02:45:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> It's not a proper city until it has ocelots.
[02:45:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Well, this looks different from the last time I saw it.
[02:45:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Yeah, I tore it down and rebuilt it.
[02:46:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> It is now better, faster, and stronger.
[02:46:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> I should do that with student housing.
[02:46:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Its hardness, though, is unchanged.
[02:46:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> It's really a mess.
[02:46:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Eh, it works.
[02:46:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> 20 stacks of sugar cane at the moment.
[02:47:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Well, with the hoppers and half-wall it has gotten a lot harder to get in and out of the garden area
[02:47:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> What's up with those hoppers anyway?
[02:47:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> And that lava blade
[02:47:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Err, guess the lava's gone.
[02:47:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> I took that down. If you don't have lava/signs there, the outside golems go through there.
[02:48:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Ah
[02:48:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Put up signs, and apparently it changes their pathing.
[02:48:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Hmm... a shephard has apparently taken up residence in my maintenance room.
[02:48:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Guess he's not hurting anyone.
[02:49:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Four pigs.
