[03:37:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> Please.
[03:37:57] [Server thread/INFO]: [qrush: Teleported jeremiahfelt to qrush]
[03:38:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> Thank you.
[03:38:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> I had no idea where I was.
[03:38:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> you get one :P
[03:38:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> I was caving and fell in this wonderful pit. Managed to land in water, but there was literally NO..
[03:38:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> way up or out.
[03:38:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> once again anyone for ice shard biome?
[03:39:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <p1agu3> To be teleported to it?
[03:39:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> I think he said there was a netherportal.
[03:39:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> Nope, need to hoof if 1km through the nether :)
[03:39:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <p1agu3> ah, np np. I understand
[03:39:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> We should set up a rail line there.
[03:40:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[03:40:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> There is, almost
[03:40:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> it's halfway built.
[03:40:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> What more do we need?
[03:40:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> because it goes to the nether fortress.
[03:40:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> i have ~2 stacks of iron back at my base at the spikes.
[03:40:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> and i found a mineshaft with a ton of rail too.
[03:40:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> and lots of gold.
[03:41:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> I have four stacks of rails. Need some gold to make powered rails, but we can lay that out.
[03:41:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> Sure.
[03:41:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> You can have your pick of gold or iron horse armor if you tag along
[03:41:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> I respectfully decline, as I already have one of each. :-)
[03:42:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> jaja
[03:42:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I'd go, but I have 3 floors of glass pane to put up
[03:42:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> and then sleep
[03:42:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> Yeah. city hall still needs glass.
[03:42:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> blocks or panes?
[03:42:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> been doing mostly white frosted.
[03:43:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I'm just doing clear on my building
[03:43:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> what do I need for white frosted?

[03:44:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> Got my rail, got redstone, got wood; do we need anything else in The Nether?
[03:44:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> For the rail to the ice spikes?
[03:44:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> Sure.
[03:44:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> nothing i know of

[03:45:42] [Server thread/WARN]: jeremiahfelt moved wrongly!
[03:45:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> Toward city hall, yeah.
[03:46:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> Start at the Nether Portal in front of city hall?
[03:47:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> hey
[03:47:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> rt
[03:47:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> no lets go to the start

[03:48:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> sure you dont want to get a ride??
[03:49:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> so the railway is this way.
[03:49:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> whered you go?

[03:50:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> Does it make you nervous thinking about all the lava above you?
[03:50:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> no, i've played too much dwarf fortress
[03:50:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> i think we could build the rail way out to the netherhood.
[03:51:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> it definitely starts in that tunenl
[03:51:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> so we could link it up using the existing pathway
[03:51:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> Where is that?
[03:51:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> the start?
[03:51:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> The existing pathway.
[03:51:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> we are on the existing pathway.
[03:51:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> this is a huge tunnel that goes to a netherfort.
[03:51:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> Ah, so the sidewalk here; not an other rail spur.
[03:52:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> Do you want to start down here, or up, above the stairs?
[03:52:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> probably going back as close as possible to the netherhood would be best

[03:57:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Did you build a bed out there?
[03:57:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> Nope.
[03:57:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Or an ender chest?
[03:57:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Ok
[03:58:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> I'll bring stuff.
[03:58:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> but where we killed it last time was good too
[03:59:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> we could also try the bedrock approach

[05:20:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Um.
[05:21:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> ?
[05:21:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> So, like... these spiraling stairs are a problem if we want a bigger beacon
[05:21:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> why
[05:21:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> theres space between the stairs
[05:21:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> For one light, not 6.
[05:22:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> you can do it horizontally
[05:22:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> i believe the space is aligned east/west
[05:23:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Well, we'll still need bigger. But I think I'll deal with this next weekend.

[05:23:48] [Server thread/INFO]: McPhage has just earned the achievement [Beaconator]
[05:23:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> lol
[05:24:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> I put the beacon and the required ingredients to expand the one beacon -> 2 down
[05:25:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[05:25:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> But it's on the wrong side. Either I'll fix it next weekend, or someone else can.
[05:25:26] [Server thread/INFO]: [qrush: Teleported qrush to McPhage]
[05:25:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> But it's iron and (mostly) gold 'cause I can't match the emerald and diamonds that are down already
[05:25:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> yes it needs to go on the other side.
[05:26:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> so it linesup with the spaces in the stair
[05:26:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Like I said, we'll still need it 2x3 eventually
[05:26:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> But that's someone else's problem.
[05:26:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> Maybe this isnt the best space for it.
[05:27:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> 1 achievement to go and I'll have them all
[05:27:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> dang whaat
[05:27:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> or another idea - we could put it on the top floor
[05:27:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> then we dont have to cut through so many floors
[05:27:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> and it still works down below right?
[05:27:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> That might work better? Not sure how many floors down the power goes, tho'
[05:28:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Seems to
[05:28:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> this jump boost is bananas
[05:29:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Ah, don't have it at Y=11 :-(
[05:29:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> Eh?
[05:29:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> I do get it at Y=18
[05:30:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[05:30:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> ah you went way down?
[05:30:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Yeah
[05:30:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Anyway, I'm heading back to my sheep, and then to bed.
[05:31:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> semi impressed you actually spring down onto the spring piston.
[05:32:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> We could move the beacon to Will's tower
[05:32:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> he already dug down to bedrock
[05:32:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> and it's next to city hall.
[05:32:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> he dug the entire block out down to bedrock
[05:33:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> It can't have anything above it.
[05:33:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> i'm sure he wont mind removing the roof a little for some glass.
[05:33:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> its already mostly a glass roof
[05:33:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> What else is in his tower?
[05:34:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> not much
[05:34:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> but a large pit
[05:34:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> in fact it's already centered around a 2x3 antenna thing
[05:34:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> at the top, a bunch of fence posts

[05:35:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> I wouldn't give wlll that much credit.
[05:35:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> (Coworker)
[05:35:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Ouch ;-)
[05:36:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> So many cats.

[05:38:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Anyway, your book is in my library. Help yourself to whatever you want in here,
[05:38:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Just if you use the anvil a bunch of times, please toss me some iron; I gave up almost
[05:38:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> All of it for the beacon
