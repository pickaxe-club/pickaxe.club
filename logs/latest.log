[05:24:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> same.
[05:24:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <bensawyer> make stuff go boom!
[05:24:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> I think I have 30.
[05:24:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <npdoty> well, you could leave a note and cut off parts of houses, rather than completely rebuilding
[05:25:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[05:25:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <npdoty> although I would love to be there for the giant TNT explosion of a block of houses found unacceptabl
[05:26:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> two blocks directly east of city hall are an eyesore :P

[05:32:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <npdoty> who built the Giant Sheep?
[05:32:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> McPhage
[05:32:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <npdoty> a work of art
[05:32:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> quite
[05:32:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> we tried to figure out how to make its mouth open and then barf out sheep
[05:32:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> but spawning sheep is hard
[05:33:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> WOW who made the map??
[05:33:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> As would be a mandibular mechanism.
[05:33:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> i want a big one of these. so neat.
[05:33:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <npdoty> where's the map?
[05:33:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> City hall.

[05:40:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> basement of city hall is in poor shape
[05:40:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <bensawyer> basement or the mine?
[05:40:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> Just under with the speakeasy, door entrance, and beacon
[05:42:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <bensawyer> it does seem a bit disorganized
[05:43:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> quite
[05:43:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <bensawyer> not sure what you'd want to do...
[05:43:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> it's a basement :)
[05:44:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <bensawyer> right
[05:44:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> i started a room for the beacon.
[05:44:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> i think restoring the individual rooms might be nice
[05:44:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> upstairs is already an open floorplan.
[05:45:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <bensawyer> think first you just need to establish the front here
[05:45:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[05:45:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <bensawyer> where's the "front" of the basement
[05:45:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> right. no idea why this is opened up
[05:45:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> or make it into a big tv/sports bar :P
[05:45:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> lots of lounge chairs.
[05:46:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> check out the tourism office on the second floor for an example of that
[05:46:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> can combine beds to make couches
[05:46:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <bensawyer> wow
[05:46:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <bensawyer> nice
[05:47:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> i need to work on the other floors, but spent this weekend exploring mostly
[05:47:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <bensawyer> hah
[05:47:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <bensawyer> yeah I've been exploring more than building the past 2 weekends
[05:47:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <bensawyer> need to finish our danger room
[05:47:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <npdoty> because everyone else has built so much!
[05:48:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> i'm wiped. night
