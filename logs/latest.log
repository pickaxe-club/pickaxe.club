[03:20:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> There is? I thought the layers were closer together than that.
[03:21:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> They don't spawn in the other farm, do they?
[03:21:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> yeah, but I'm starting at the bottom
[03:22:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> so are we building this because the other one is overused or just this one is more accessible?
[03:22:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> the location is bad for the other one
[03:22:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> pigmen spawn below in hub
[03:22:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Especially because some moron built a library where people spend a lot of time.
[03:23:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> is that the lower or upper library?
[03:23:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> There's more than one?
[03:23:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> at the original XP farm?
[03:24:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> The librarian library, not the enchanting room.
[03:24:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> ah
[03:24:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I should put my headphones on

[03:26:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> thank you!
[03:28:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Added some ladders to the slime jump so you don't have to wait for the bounces to stop.
[03:28:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> just hold down the space bar
[03:28:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> you won't bounce
[03:28:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> But then you lose the slime benefit.
[03:28:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> no damamge
[03:29:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> I just push towards the exit and hit my head on the ceiling no damage
[03:29:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> You sure about that? I always end up with damage.
[03:29:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I didn't get any

[03:30:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> it being glass would stop that.
[03:30:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> Maybe add a piston w/ slime block that pushes you out
[03:30:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> use tripwire to trigger. ;)

[03:32:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> so space bar
[03:33:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Yeah, does "normal jump" mean "instead of bounce"?
[03:34:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Yes, I think it does. Though I only jumped from the black level of the bouncy castle.
[03:35:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[03:35:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I was jumping from the new farm earlier just fine
[03:36:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Yep, it's space bar.

[03:50:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Huh. Tested the dark oak tree farm. Came up with two saplings and two apples, so a net loss.
[03:50:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Probably shouldn't replant until the leaves had all decayed with those.
[03:52:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> those ghasts like you CobyR

[03:53:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> hopefully we can go run around the base and find a few tears when we are done
[03:53:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I have 5 so far
[03:53:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> nice
[03:53:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> switch to looting 3 sword before arrow hits
[03:53:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> seems to help
[03:55:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[03:57:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I may have overdone it w/ the smooth stone. :)
[03:57:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> got a little extra do you?
[03:57:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> I came with an inventory full, but went through that already
[03:58:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> maybe that's why there's so much. Already had plenty

[03:59:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> o/
[03:59:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> what was for dinner?
[03:59:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> What the heck was I doing? I'm on a pillar ~20 up in the air.
[03:59:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Delicious sausage stew.
[03:59:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Ah right- working on the mechanism stuff.
[03:59:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> LOL
[03:59:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> does sound tasty
[04:00:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[04:02:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> leve 3 done?
[04:02:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> time for glass
[04:02:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> do we have glass here?
[04:02:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Wow- that's quite a bit of progress.
[04:02:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> There's a bunch of glass down here at the bottom.
[04:03:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> ~30 stacks
[04:03:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> I'm running back to shuffalo to pick up some redstone supplies. Anyone need anything.
[04:03:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> *?
[04:03:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> LOL we suck
[04:04:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> ?
[04:04:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> I have a standard bow so don't do nearly enough damage
[04:04:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> can't hit it
[04:04:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Lol- ghast fighiting?
[04:04:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> glass and dye over here
[04:05:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[04:05:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> any glass below fish?
[04:05:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Yeah, 30 stacks. :)
[04:05:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> where is the dye?
[04:05:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I mean that got blown off
[04:05:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> sacks in the small chest now
[04:05:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I'm down here. picked it up
[04:05:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Oh, didn't see. At shuffalo now.
[04:05:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> find it CobyR?
[04:05:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> yup
[04:06:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> did we lose the crafting table?
[04:06:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I picked it up
[04:07:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> maybe black wasn't the best contrast to use
[04:07:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> It'll look cool when it's done, though. :)
[04:07:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Are you all set for dye?
[04:07:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> probably
[04:08:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> don't forget the inner fence
[04:09:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Ah yeah. I'll grab some nether brick
[04:09:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> we could do every other row of glass no?
[04:09:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> netherbrick or should we use cobble fence?
[04:09:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> or evey 3rd?
[04:09:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> that would keep ghast out?
[04:09:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Hmm... I think that'd work.
[04:09:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> but then we'd fall in and get clobbered
[04:09:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> True
[04:10:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[04:13:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I think we're going to need more glass
[04:13:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> haven't checked the base though
[04:15:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[04:20:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[04:20:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> how much glass do you have CobyR?
[04:20:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> 48 pieces left
[04:20:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> out now
[04:20:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> I'll bring some up from the base
[04:21:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> just grabbed 8 stack sfrom the base headed back up
[04:21:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> maybe we half slab the top ;)
[04:21:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> There's a bunch up top now. :)
[04:21:44] [Server thread/INFO]: CobyR fell from a high place
[04:21:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> NO!
[04:21:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> O.o
[04:21:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> how the heck?
[04:22:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> apparently hit the edge of the slime block
[04:22:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Looks like you hit the edge of the ladder
[04:22:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> no FF?
[04:22:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Wouldn't recommend putting a ladder there.
[04:22:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> killer ladders
[04:23:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> yea just regular diamond gear - when I quit playing last night I thought I closed my laptop,
[04:23:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Your stuff is in the bottom chest at the base.
[04:23:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> left it open enough to stop it from sleeping - died, all my stuff disapated...
[04:23:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> loged back on this morning to a you have died screen
[04:23:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> ah. I always log out and close the game
[04:23:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Gonna remove these ladders. If you fall right up against the stone, you'll hit the ladder top.
[04:23:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> yea usually do, but ...
[04:24:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> the one time....
[04:25:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[04:25:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> do you need me to put your stuff in a chest?
[04:25:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> no I'll be back in just a moment
[04:25:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Ah, already put it in a chest.
[04:25:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> thats fine too
[04:26:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> need way more glass
[04:26:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> twice as much as what we had
[04:28:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> switching to Chroma hills. Now I can see the glass
[04:30:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[04:31:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Ah, forgot to pick up a piece of packed ice.
[04:31:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I have some in shuffalo...I think
[04:31:53] [Server thread/INFO]: CobyR fell from a high place
[04:32:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> O.o
[04:32:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> oops
[04:32:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> oops
[04:32:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> did you have your stuff already?
[04:32:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> yup
[04:32:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> was putting in glass and forgot the inner circle isn't fenced off
[04:32:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> anything you need before I come back again?
[04:32:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> check my basement for packed ice. Need a piece
[04:33:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> if you are coming from shuffalo. Mushroom (red roof) building
[04:33:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Stuff's in the box again. :)
[04:33:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> pickaxe city or shuffalo xcave?
[04:33:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> shuffalo
[04:33:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> thanks fishtoaster
[04:33:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> far column of chests
[04:33:29] [Server thread/WARN]: CobyR moved wrongly!
[04:33:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I think the top one
[04:35:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[04:36:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> got it
[04:36:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> if you see any glass in there, bring it too
[04:36:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> though I doubt I have any
[04:36:56] [Server thread/INFO]: CobyR tried to swim in lava
[04:37:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> O.o
[04:37:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> oh man
[04:37:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> what the hell... someone put a pit of lava in the middle of shuffalo
[04:37:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> wasn't paying attention
[04:37:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> ROFL
[04:37:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Oh
[04:37:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Heh
[04:37:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> that sucks...but is funny too
[04:37:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Was that, by any chance, directly underneath the UFO?
[04:37:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> at how absurd it is
[04:37:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> could of been :)
[04:37:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> With a sign saying "CAUTION: Lava"?
[04:37:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> ROFL
[04:37:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Heh- should put a fence around that.
[04:38:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> I'll have to look :)
[04:38:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> probably doesn't help if you're looking at the UFO
[04:38:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> going to get another piece of packed ice
[04:38:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> It's the bottom half of the iron farm in the ufo.
[04:38:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> right
[04:38:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> the lava blade
[04:38:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> The packed ice should, eventually, end up in the sorter.
[04:38:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Should definitely put a fence there.
[04:38:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> at least he was naked
[04:39:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> comedy of errors
[04:39:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> yes that was a positive
[04:39:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I think I'm quite tired because I'm laughing pretty good over here
[04:39:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> the reaction was what was funny
[04:40:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[04:40:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Heh
[04:40:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> let it be known, fishtoaster has been the cause of multiple CobyR deaths tonight
[04:40:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> lol
[04:40:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> lol
[04:40:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> I'd say I was the cause, he just provided the opportunity
[04:41:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> yup there is a sign facing east I was coming south
[04:42:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> moving south from a north position that is
[04:42:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Poor UX on my part
[04:42:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> need a 2x high fence since we have jump boost there
[04:42:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> True that.
[04:42:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> ice in tow, back in the nether, should be there shortly
[04:43:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> out of glass
[04:44:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> found 4 more stacks

[04:45:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> did you get the ones I was carrying?
[04:45:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Off for a bit. Might be back on to continue working on the redstone later.

[04:45:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> ok I'll put ice in the chest
[04:45:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> no, probably at base in your stuff
[04:45:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> ok I think there is 8 there, I'll bring it up
[04:47:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I'm out
[04:48:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> I have four stacks and change
[04:48:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> probalby won't be enough
[04:48:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> well, it may
[04:49:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I think it's just the center that needs filling now
[04:50:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[04:50:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> you know you can just drop stacks from inventory?
[04:50:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> thx
[04:50:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> yea that would of been easier
[04:51:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> put a block on the ladder block too
[04:52:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> are you out?
[04:52:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> 85 pieces left
[04:52:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> need about 280
[04:53:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> going to check my inventory
[04:54:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> but I don't think the ghasts will spawn in the hollow areas
[04:54:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I'm goign to steal upper shuffalo's. I think leaving every 3rd row is enough

[05:05:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> sounds good
