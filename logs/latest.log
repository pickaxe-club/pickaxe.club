[00:23:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> just manually sort those

[04:06:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <wuapinmon> Yes, indeed.
[04:06:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Where the cart is sitting, that's a detector rail. That flips the torch underneath the dispenser.

[04:07:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> That's what all the substations at Pickaxe Station and Upper Shuffalo do.
[04:07:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <wuapinmon> cool
[04:07:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> The cart return is the top part. Activator rail under that torch, that kicks the player out.

[04:08:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Problem is, a cargo cart blows up on the cactus, so we want to divert those.
[04:08:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <wuapinmon> so, there's a torch under the bottom cart?
[04:08:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Under the dispenser, against the block under the cart.
[04:09:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <wuapinmon> got it
[04:09:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> If the station ever runs out of carts, you'll have to manually place a cart on that detector
