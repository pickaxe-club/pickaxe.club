[01:30:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <mtodd> or just curve around it?
[01:30:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <bensawyer> maybe put the portal up on the hill

[01:30:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <mtodd> or inconvenient?

[03:55:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> i think up here is fine though.
[03:56:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Good gravy, we need a nether portal to get to the top of this place.
[03:56:42] [Server thread/INFO]: There are 6/20 players online:
[03:56:42] [Server thread/INFO]: CobyR, tyrosinase, McPhage, qrush, bensawyer, jeremiahfelt
[03:56:47] [Server thread/INFO]: Given [Glass] * 64 to qrush
[03:57:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> There's a fence up here, but NOTHING AROUND THOSE STAIRS?!
[03:57:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> Read the wall.
[03:58:20] [Server thread/WARN]: bensawyer moved wrongly!
[03:58:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> yeah we need some more floors
[03:58:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> What we need is a splash pit between the two staircases.
[03:58:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> city hall is big!
[03:58:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> Approved.

[04:00:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Whew. I am never going up there again.
[04:00:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> lol
[04:00:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <jeremiahfelt> yeah, need a better way. trying to figure out a redstone elevator that works in 1.8.1
[04:00:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> i maybe tried 6-7 different staircase designs.
[04:00:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> i dont have a problem with this one...
[04:01:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> I keep turning too steeply and getting hung up.
[04:01:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> but YMMV
[04:01:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> going down is easy. just look down and circle around
[04:01:34] [Server thread/WARN]: McPhage moved wrongly!
[04:04:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> ah, i placed some extra planks on the stairs
[04:04:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> that might help make it easier
[04:04:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> but not make it safer ;)
[04:05:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[04:05:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> going down it's nice to use both
[04:07:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> i think it's time to expand the blocks west and northward
[04:07:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <qrush> plenty in the other directions
