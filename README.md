# pickaxe.club

**A weekend-only vanilla survival Minecraft server & community.**

This is a lesson in self-control:
Is it possible to play Minecraft and not lose oneself in it? The answer is mostly no, but this idea of
time-capped play has appealed to many builders and adventures over the past year. After 52 weekends of 
laborious effort, the world itself is now open source for the community to make maps, explore, and just
do anything they'd like with their creations. Enjoy.

# Conduct

Please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/qrush/Pickaxe-Code-Of-Conduct) before continuing.

# Gameplay

Want to play? If you'd like to play with everyone: You'll have to get on Slack to see the server IP of the week. Ping @qrush on twitter for an invite until we get an auto-inviter wired up.

The basic gist is: Be nice, don't destroy or steal, build where there's open space. Oh and don't be afraid to ask questions! We'll be happy to answer them via our chat bot, [wither](https://github.com/qrush/wither):
