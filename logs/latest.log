[00:45:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Well, the lag seems to have settled down.
[00:46:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <wuapinmon> I blame xcave.
[00:46:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <wuapinmon> no reason, just cause
[00:46:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Good general policy.
[00:46:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I agree.
[01:00:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <wuapinmon> how's it look?
[01:01:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Pretty good from out here
[01:01:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> I think I got a bullseye on my last shot

[01:06:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <PhilBates> Hi everybody!
[01:06:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> o/
[01:06:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> o/
[01:06:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <wuapinmon> o/
[01:07:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <PhilBates> I joined another server so I could play during the week, but it makes me really appreciate what we..
[01:07:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <PhilBates> have here
[01:07:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Same thing happened to me when I tried a weekday server.
[01:07:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <wuapinmon> me too
[01:08:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <wuapinmon> Not sharing, too much griefing, too much cussing, and too many rules.
[01:08:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <PhilBates> I went on a white-listed server. Creeper holes are automatically filled.
[01:08:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <PhilBates> You can't light your own portals...
[01:08:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> That's... odd.
[01:08:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <PhilBates> too much limitation on farm animals, etc, etc.
[01:08:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <wuapinmon> yeah, no flint and steel allowed most places
[01:08:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <PhilBates> yep
[01:09:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Weird. Never seen that restriction.
[01:09:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> What's the reasoning?
[01:09:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <wuapinmon> people will literally burn your stuff down and laugh about it
[01:09:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Wow
[01:09:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <PhilBates> They don't anyone setting fire, killing and pillaging...
[01:10:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <wuapinmon> some won't let you even place a block or mine a block in someone else's "home" chunk
[01:10:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Ah right- protected chunks.
[01:10:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <PhilBates> I know, it is white-listed, but I guess that means little.
[01:10:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <PhilBates> yes, protected chunks
[01:10:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> It's amazing how far weekend only + rotating url has taken us.
[01:11:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <PhilBates> they have a "resource nether"
[01:11:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <PhilBates> they reset it every two weeks.
[01:11:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> you're giving qrush too many ideas. ;)
[01:11:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <PhilBates> :)
[01:11:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> What's the purpose of the resource nether?
[01:12:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <PhilBates> Actually, I am not sure, I never went there. I assume that it makes it easy to gather them.
[01:12:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <PhilBates> They still have the regular nether that you can travel to with portals.
[01:13:49] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /54.198.132.18
[01:14:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> all things we can work on
[01:14:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <PhilBates> Yeah. they also limit mob counts. I wanted to get some Ghast tears, but almost no Ghasts showed up.
[01:15:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> so there were only Phil tears.
[01:15:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> sorry, I'm on a bad roll here
[01:15:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <PhilBates> ha ha!.
[01:15:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Heh
[01:15:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <PhilBates> Seriously, I don't like to be a complainer, they are probably doing the best they can... I guess.
[01:16:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Yeah, I guess it's hard to build a decent community.
