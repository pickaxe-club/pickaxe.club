[02:43:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Regen potions are usually sufficient. Strength is good. Speed is good.
[02:43:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> feel free to take potions in the brewery
[02:43:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> good thing we have a brewery
[02:43:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> haha
[02:43:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> regen is in the basement
[02:43:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> thanks to your ghast tears :)
[02:43:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> ryanbates: where's the brewery?
[02:43:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> those tears are finally going to come in handy

[02:52:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> brewing some str 2 up
[02:52:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> awesome, thanks
[02:52:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Heading to town
[02:52:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> let's meet at the brewery
[02:52:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Sounds good.
[02:53:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Glad I built this rail line from my house to pickaxe. :)
[02:53:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> cool, one more for the posse
[02:53:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> does str 1 not kill wither skeletons in 1 hit?
[02:53:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> I'm going to go grab some hops potions
[02:53:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> ryanbates: not wither skeletons, the wither boss
[02:53:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> oh, fighting the boss, nice
[02:53:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> tyrosinase wants more beacons
[02:53:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> MORE BEACONS FOR THE BEACON GOD
[02:54:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> lol
[02:54:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> lol
[02:54:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> haha
[02:54:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> what Tyro wants....Tyro gets...
[02:54:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Goddess.
[02:54:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> tyrosinase: tell that to Khrone
[02:54:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Bah. the western nether rail is all torn up. I'll have to cover that better, I guess.
[02:54:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> can we move it to the other side
[02:55:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[02:55:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> The rail? Sure.
[02:55:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> seems to be on the wrong side. Most entrances are on the side it's on
[02:55:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Fair enough.
[02:55:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> same w/ the north one.
[02:55:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I can help
[02:55:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> Yeah, that's why I hadn't laid rail down yet. Trying to decide if it would mess up the netherhood
[02:55:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> if I ran the roof out onto its streets enough to protect the rail.
[02:56:09] [Server thread/WARN]: tyrosinase moved wrongly!
[02:56:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> strength 2 potions are in the bottom two rows of the strength chest in the brewery now
[02:56:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> ryanbates: thanks
[02:56:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Nice brewery. :0
[02:56:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> thx

[02:57:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> *:)
[02:59:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> how many strengths do we need?
[02:59:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Eh, a few? How many withers are we going to kill?
[02:59:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> dropped off 1.5 stacks of powder
[02:59:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> 2
[02:59:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> at least
[02:59:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> thanks
[02:59:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Suppose it's good I just upgraded my bow to power V.
[02:59:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> How many beacons are in place already?
[02:59:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> 2
[03:00:01] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
[03:00:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> So a full set would be 4 more withers.
[03:00:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> true
[03:00:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> but the hole is good for 4
[03:00:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> The hole?
[03:00:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> she built a pit
[03:01:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> anyway, 2 or 4 more, it's all good.
[03:01:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> you have 8 minute speeds ryan?
[03:01:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> I could do without the stupid Jump one.
[03:01:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> yeah, in the speed chest
[03:01:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> tyrosinase: whaaaaa? That's my favorite
[03:01:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> speed chest on the main floor
[03:01:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> speed is my favorite, then jump
[03:02:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Um, true. Speed is better. But speed then jump.
[03:02:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <tyrosinase> I hate jump when I'm trying to build.
[03:03:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> do we need fire resist?
[03:03:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> I don't think it actually helps? But it's a cheap enough potion that I drink it just in case.
[03:03:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> wither doesn't use fire attacks, but who knows he might blow you up into a lava pool

[03:06:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> give the wither a chance ;)
[03:06:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> golden apples actually

[03:06:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> make you HULK SMASH!
[03:07:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Heh. I think with all our diamond armor and potions, we'll probably be fine.
[03:07:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I'm wearing my iron man armor under my regular armor, just in case
[03:07:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Reading up on withers now. Apparently you need three wither skulls to create one.
[03:07:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Do we have a bunch of those?
[03:07:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> fishtoaster: yes
[03:08:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> We good to go?
[03:08:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> I'm all set.

[03:27:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> thought it gave you XP
[03:27:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> And it turns dark
[03:27:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> xcave: nope :-(
[03:27:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> maybe it was me.
[03:27:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> well, that was fun
[03:27:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> the dragon gave tons of XP. the wither, none :-(
[03:28:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Wanno do any more? Could always use more nether stars. :)

[03:28:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> xcave: can you make the beacons? I have obsidian if you need
[03:28:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> sure. I can get it too.
[03:29:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> Ok, then I'll leave the stars to you.
[03:29:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <McPhage> fishtoaster: prolly next weekend? I'd like to get some more in town.

[04:52:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Might be worth experimenting with.
[04:52:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> hmm, not sure if I tried that
[04:53:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> now I'm curious, will brb in creative

[04:53:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> I save my creative experimenting for week days
[04:53:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I've never been in creative
[04:53:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Great way to try out concepts.
[04:53:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> yep. Just haven't had any yet. :)
[04:54:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> still learning the basics
[04:54:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> I think you're past the basics when you're fighting withers. :P
[04:54:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> haha. Ok. I had a lot of help getting over the learning curve.
[04:54:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> but I only started playing mid February I think.

[04:55:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> I think I was pretty similar. One of my coworkers got into this game, and infected the whole office
[04:55:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Ah, bummer.
[04:55:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> nope, can't pass upsidown stairs or slabs
[04:56:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> piston time :P
[04:56:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> :D
[04:56:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> man that was expensive - combine ef4 diamond pick axe with ef4 diamond pickaxe w fortune, ef4, ub3
[04:56:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> cost 23 levels
[04:56:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Oof
[04:56:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> did you repair either one before?
[04:57:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> next one is TOO EXPENSIVE
[04:57:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> both were brand new, no usage
[04:57:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> but now I have an Ef5, Ub3, Fortune 3 pickaxe :)

[04:57:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Don't break it- it'll cost a fortune to fix. :P
[04:58:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Yeah, my loadout is about the same as tyrosinase's.
[04:58:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> did you try switching them in the anvil?
[04:58:24] [Server thread/INFO]: CobyR hit the ground too hard
[04:58:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> Nice Tyro. That's what I carry too.
[04:59:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I have EF4 UB3 for regular work. I think have 3 right now. I repair w/ a plain one. Cheap that way.
[04:59:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Yep.
[04:59:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> I have a handful of EF5s, though I can't really tell them from EF4s.

[05:00:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <ryanbates> yeah, that is satisfying
[05:00:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I went through several of those gathering the sand for Atlantis, then clearing it.
[05:00:41] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /54.147.180.49
[05:00:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> just got stuck in the ender farm and died :(
[05:00:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> EF4 w/ UB3 and it still would wear out super fast
[05:01:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <fishtoaster> Yeah, I was gathering sand with EF5 shovels. Burns through them so fast.
[05:01:11] [RCON Listener #1/INFO]: Rcon connection from: /54.147.180.49
[05:01:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> yep

[05:02:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <xcave> I think it goes fast because you go through so much sand so fast. So you get your use out of it fast
