[04:51:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <PhilBates> Ah. Yeah, we are on the other side of the Cascades, so it is a little bit wetter.
[04:53:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> My wife and I are actually planning a move to Lincoln City, daughter and grand kids there
[04:53:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <CobyR> so we'll be on the wetter side then
